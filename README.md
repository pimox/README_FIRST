# Proxmox for the Raspberry Pi

This set of repos contains a port of Proxmox for the Raspberry Pi 4 based on Debian Buster 64-bit.

The easy option is to look at https://github.com/minkebox/repo for instructions on installing the pre-build packages on your Debian install.

Alternatively, you can download and rebuild these packages yourself. To make that a little easier I've provided a LXC container you can run
on a Raspberry Pi which has already been setup so building new packages versions is simple.
