# Proxmox for the Raspberry Pi

This set of repos contains a port of Proxmox for the Raspberry Pi 4 based on Debian Buster 64-bit.

The easy option is to look at https://github.com/minkebox/pimox for instructions on installing the pre-build packages on your Debian install.

The slightly less easy option is to [download the LXC tarball](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0b_kkIWL4SyZbWHSXyXCJuAjw#proxmox-builder-debian-buster-10.9%5Farm64.tar), which contains a pre-configured environment and Proxmox sources, and use that to build the debian packages
from the sources.

Finally, you can download and rebuild these packages yourself.
